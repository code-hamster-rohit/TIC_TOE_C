# TIC_TOE_C
This is a game of Tic - Tac -Toe programed in c where two user plays the game but with a twist.
Let P1 -> X and P2 -> O be the two players.
P1 scores 3 points if it fills all three cells of a
row/column/diagonal with X similar for P2.
P1 scores 1 point if it stops P2 scoring 3 points, i.e., P1 fills X in
a cell of a row/column/diagonal in which P2 has already filled
two cells with O.
Similar are the rules for P2.
This game goes endlessly until and unless all rows and coloumn are filled.
Cumulative score gets counted, so don't loose even 1 point!
